# E-commerce-EDA-and-Machine-Learining

This repository contains code and analysis for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) on an E-commerce dataset.
The goal of this project is to gain insights into the E-commerce data and build a predictive model to understand the factors that influence customer spending.

+ **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is an E-commerce dataset containing information on customer behaviour,
including Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership, and Yearly Amount Spent. See the data folder for a preview.

+ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
In the code, I perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify relationships between features, and gain insights into customer behaviour. 
The EDA includes data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

+ **Machine Learning (ML)**
In the code, I build a Linear Regression model to predict the Yearly Amount Spent based on customer behaviour features.
The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization of results and my remark.
